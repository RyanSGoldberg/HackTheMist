Global Brands, Global Choices Our brands continue to expand globally, and 2017 saw our restaurants introduced in a number of new markets:• Burger King opened its first locations in Armenia, Belgium, Luxembourg and Saint Kitts and Nevis.• Tim Hortons opened its first locations in Great Britain, Mexico, Spain and the Philippines.• Popeyes® opened its first locations in Lebanon, Palestine and South Africa.We have plans to further expand the global presence of each of our brands. In addition to offering our global guests the classic menu items that define our brands, we also continue to work with our partners to offer new menu choices that reflect local and cultural preferences. Here are a few highlights from regions around the world:• Our Burger King brand offers the VEGGIE WHOPPER® in India and the Picanha line in Brazil.• Our Tim Hortons brand offers the Triple Coffee Jelly ICED CAPP™ Supreme in the Philippines, the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich in the UK and the Caprese Panini in Spain.• Our Popeyes brand offers Spicy Chicken Pilaf and a variety of Chicken Paninis in Turkey.Nutrition Information Access Increasing access to nutrition information allows guests to make informed choices that meet the needs of their individual lifestyles. In 2017, we focused on expanding the presence of this information through our digital platforms:• Tim Hortons® launched their mobile ordering app in Canada, complete with nutrition information. We understand the importance of providing nutrition information at the point of ordering, and our mobile app allows guests to find the information they need in one convenient location. • Burger King® improved guest access to nutrition information by enhancing their website’s capabilities for meal building. Guests now have the option to build a meal and see the complete nutritional information of their selections.Nutrition and ChildrenOffering nutritious menu items for children is an important part of providing healthier options for our guests. In the United States, the Burger King “KING JR™” menu continues to add options such as Welch’s® PB&J Jamwich, which are compliant with all Kids LiveWell Program criteria. These meals are also compliant with the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, which ensures that meals meet nutritional standards set for calories, saturated fat, sodium and added sugar for all meals marketed to children.Balanced Menu OptionsWe understand that our guests are looking for a variety of menu options, and our Research and Development teams continuously explore ways to add great-tasting, balanced menu items that meet the needs of our guests globally. A recent example of our commitment to balanced options was the introduction of Burger King’s new Grilled Chicken Sandwich, alongside the launch of their Crispy Chicken Sandwich; both delicious options featuring a whole-breast, 100% white meat chicken fillet. Food Safety and Quality AssuranceMaintaining high food safety standards in restaurants and across our vendor base is at the core of our business. Vendor audits are conducted each year to ensure that we meet the high standard of safety and quality that defines our brands.Trust and QualityNutritionTaste and Choice1110Our commitment to doing what’s right extends beyond our restaurants to our supply chain and the people, land and animals that may be impacted by our business.ProgressIn support of our Forest Commitment, in 2017 we engaged BSR, a global nonprofit business network and consultancy dedicated to sustainability, to conduct a risk assessment of our key commodity supply chains. The assessment conducted included beef, palm oil, soy in poultry feed, coffee and fiber-based packaging, and evaluated the likelihood, severity and scale of potential deforestation and human rights risks in our supply chains.Building on the assessment results, we worked with BSR to draft commodity-specific goals that expand on our existing forest commitment. In early 2018, BSR completed a round of one-on-one engagement with a select group of our shareholders and expert stakeholders to solicit input and feedback on our goals and overall approach. To support achievement of our goals, we are undertaking further work to enhance our responsible sourcing strategy and align the procurement processes with our responsible sourcing vision and commitments. As we look to strengthen our approach in managing deforestation risk alongside our goal to eliminate deforestation in our global supply chains, we are closely monitoring developments of leading multi-stakeholder initiatives and organizations and looking to align our approach as appropriate. Forest Commitment11  Vendor CodeRestaurant Brands InternationalTM is a global citizen. We live and work alongside our constituents, and value their interests as our own. Fundamental respect for all people, and our planet, guides our corporate conscience. Restaurant Brands International is committed to diversity and inclusion, dignity for all workers along our entire supply chain, food safety and animal welfare, sensitivity towards the environment, and a spectrum of civic and charitable priorities that promote our shared future in the communities we serve.We also believe that our vendors should observe the same philosophy in their actions and relationships affecting Restaurant Brands International. We appreciate that these vendors are independent businesses that manage their operations and their employees in their sole discretion. We also recognize that our vendors may operate in areas of the world where legal and cultural norms differ from ours. Even so, our vendors provide the ingredients in our food, the equipment used to make it and many other critical inputs into our business. That’s why our commitment to “doing what’s right” simply can’t be achieved without the same commitment from them. That’s also why Restaurant Brands International has established our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct for Vendors – to set forth the basic requirements that must be met by all vendors. Compliance with this Code is each vendor’s individual responsibility. It is also the responsibility of vendors to ensure that their employees, officers, agents and subcontractors (including sub-assembly factories) comply with this Code. Accordingly, we recommend that vendors regularly communicate this Code and its requirements to all parties who perform work on behalf of the vendor for Restaurant Brands International.The provisions of this Code are intended only to confirm the basic requirements that must be met by vendors to Restaurant Brands International and does not create third party beneficiary rights of any kind for any third party. The requirements set out in this Code operate in addition to, not in lieu of, obligations set forth in any agreements between a vendor and Restaurant Brands International or its agents.In addition, vendors are expected to observe the basic principles set forth in our  Code of Business Ethics and Conduct for Non-Restaurant Employees, which is designed to ensure compliance by Restaurant Brands International employees with ethical guidelines and applicable laws and regulations. Vendors that have their own code of conduct for employees can meet this requirement through compliance with their own code, provided that it embodies the same philosophy and basic principles as Restaurant Brands International’s.Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Forests Program As a founding member of the CDP’s Supply Chain – Forests program, we are part of an industry effort to gather information from vendors with respect to how they are managing risks related to deforestation, including cattle products, palm oil, timber products and soy.During the program’s 2017 pilot year, we were one of eight organizations that worked with the CDP to request information from vendors including strategies for measuring and monitoring the use of key forest commodities in order to benchmark disclosure, activities and opportunities related to reducing deforestation.  While the number of responses to the questionnaire was small in this pilot year compared to the well-established Climate Change program, the data revealed some important takeaways, including that approximately three quarters of respondents reported a commitment to reduce or remove deforestation from their supply chains.*  Looking ForwardWe look forward to continuing to work collaboratively within our supply chain, through global roundtables and with other organizations to find solutions and move closer toward the elimination of deforestation.Taking key learnings from our first year, in 2018 we are expanding our participation by reaching out to vendors that collectively represent a minimum of 80% of our system-wide global spend in our priority commodities, including beef, packaging, palm oil and chicken (reflected in subsequent parts of this . We will also explore future collaborative opportunities to address risks related to deforestation with our vendors.*Source: CDP. (2017).

This includes supporting the people, places and partners across its coffee supply chain.  Using third-party verification every three years and self-audits for the years in between, Tim Hortons verifies detailed compliance with our Vendor Code, confirming that its coffee is ethically sourced. In 2017, third-party verification of compliance with the Vendor Code was undertaken at the mill level and revealed no major compliance issues, however, areas of improvement are continuously pursued.  Additionally, secondary audits were completed by vendors in Central America to further demonstrate compliance related to labour practices, where clarification was needed.    Traceability of coffee back to the mill level is validated by annual audits of the two Tim Hortons® coffee-roasting facilities by the British Retail Consortium Global Standards, an internationally recognized global food safety certification body. As in previous years, both facilities received the highest rating awarded for planned audits, which includes this level of traceability as a requirement. In 2018,Tim Hortons intends to launch an innovative partnership to benchmark and develop training initiatives related to labour in coffee supply chains.Collaboration February 2017 – Guatemala Stakeholder Meeting Tim Hortons and the Trade Facilitation Office of Canada (TFO) hosted a meeting in Guatemala City in February 2017. The goal of the meeting was to share learnings from their unique public-private partnership, formed to improve the livelihoods of small holder farmers in the coffee-growing communities of Central America, and encourage more collaboration in this area. Representatives from the TFO, Tim Hortons® and their respective in-country implementation agencies, TechnoServe and Hanns R. Neumann Stiftung (HRNS), engaged with representatives across the coffee supply chain, as well as farmer beneficiaries from the project. September 2017 – Stakeholder Roundtable In 2017, Tim Hortons collaborated with vendors, partners and the National Coffee Association to leverage knowledge of local coffee authorities in main producing countries, and to discuss the development of regional training initiatives to address important issues such as child labour and social compliance. Efforts included a multi-stakeholder roundtable meeting with participation from authorities, multi-national coffee merchants, recognized third party auditors and HRNS.Fiber-Based Packaging• In Canada and the United States, all Burger King® and Tim Hortons® fiber-based packaging vendors are sourcing board and/or paper from paper mills certified by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, Forest Stewardship Council, or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, ensuring that the fiber-based packaging we use in our restaurants is sourced from certified sustainably-managed forests.• In Europe, all Burger King and Tim Hortons packaging vendors are chain of custody certified, meeting a Forest Stewardship Council or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification standard on handling and tracking forest fiber throughout the entire supply chain.Soy• In 2018, we will encourage Tier 1 poultry vendors to join the Roundtable for Responsible Soy and engage with them to undertake a soy mapping process in our supply chain. • Based on the results of the planned soy mapping, we will require high risk vendors to establish a time-bound commitment to purchase soy that does not contribute to deforestation (e.g. certified sustainable soy).Palm Oil• In 2017, 100% of palm oil directly sourced by Restaurant Brands International supported the production of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified sustainable palm oil. 47% of that palm oil was sourced from RSPO-certified sources; an increase from 34% in 2016.• In 2018, we will participate in the North American Sustainable Palm Oil Network.• By 2020, all palm oil directly sourced, as well as palm oil and palm kernel oil used as an ingredient in our branded products, will be from suppliers who can verify sustainable production (according to RSPO NEXT and/or its equivalents) in countries where supply is commercially viable, as well as demonstrate a commitment to respecting human rights and protecting against deforestation and land conversion.   1415Animal Welfare At Restaurant Brands International, animal welfare is an issue of importance for us and our stakeholders, including our restaurant owners, vendors and guests. Throughout the global supply chain, our commitment is to improve animal welfare.In support of our Animal Welfare Approach we are making progress on the following commitments for Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants:Laying HensWe are committed to transitioning to 100% cage-free eggs globally and will accomplish this goal in Canada, Mexico, Latin America and the United States by 2025.The Burger King brand and its restaurant owners currently serve cage-free shell and liquid eggs* for breakfast in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Sows We are committed to only sourcing pork globally from vendors that do not use gestation stalls. We aim to accomplish this goal in North America by 2022 and in Latin America by 2025. Broiler Chickens To increase the welfare of broiler chickens, our vision is to make improvements in areas of breed, stocking density and environment in Canada and the United States by 2024. We will work with our vendors, animal welfare experts and others in our industry to align on solutions, requiring our vendors to verify their progress via third party auditing. Animal Welfare AuditingAll Burger King beef and poultry raw material vendors, worldwide, undertake and submit annual third party audits that include animal welfare standards. Standards for animal welfare include those from the American Meat Institute and National Chicken Council.  Beef Sustainability As a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB), we endorse their definition and core principles of sustainable beef*  as follows: The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef defines sustainable beef as a socially responsible, environmentally sound and economically viable product that prioritizes Planet (relevant principles: Natural Resources, Efficiency and Innovation, People and the Community); People (relevant principles: People and the Community and Food); Animals (relevant principle: Animal Health and Welfare); and Progress (relevant principles: Natural Resources, People and the Community, Animal Health and Welfare, Food, Efficiency and Innovation).In support of beef sustainability, we are engaging beef vendors representing 80% of our supply to support their participation in the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (or a similar initiative) and the integration of GRSB principles/criteria into supplier sustainability programs. Further, by 2020, we will ensure that specific sustainability criteria based on GRSB principles will be developed and implemented to support the supplier selection and management process in our supply chain.BeefThe CRSB Sustainable Beef Framework  The Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (CRSB), is a not-for-profit, collaborative, multi-stakeholder organization focused on advancing sustainability in the Canadian beef industry. The CRSB is also a member of the GRSB, and its main areas of work include Sustainability Benchmarking, a Certification Framework and Sustainability Projects.As an active member of the CRSB, we are proud to have contributed to their efforts to advance beef sustainability. In late 2017, the CRSB launched the much-anticipated Certified Sustainable Beef Framework. This framework is the first of its kind in the world and was developed over two years with input from the multi-stakeholder membership of the CRSB. The mission of this voluntary Framework is to drive the advancement and recognition of beef sustainability in Canada through a world class operation-level certification program. In 2018, we will support the delivery of the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef’s Certified Sustainable Beef Framework via committee participation.*Cage-free egg products do not include frozen eggs at this timePhoto credit: Beef Farmers of Ontario.1617We embrace our responsibility to do our part with respect to energy, water and waste.Waste ReductionWaste Management in RestaurantsEach year, we continue to expand our waste diversion and monitoring efforts throughout Tim Hortons restaurants, working with our restaurant owners in select locations to support participation in programs available in their area.  As of 2017, select locations with access to waste diversion for coffee grinds, organic waste, paper, plastics and hot beverage cups achieved as much as 62% waste diversion from landfills.Pitch In WeekTim Hortons sponsorship of ‘Pitch In Week’ in 2017 supported over 18,400 local community clean ups across Canada. Throughout the week, 682,263 participants contributed to efforts to clean up, restore, and preserve the environment in their local communities, with over 5.25 million pounds of litter picked up throughout the country. This year marked Pitch In Canada’s 50th anniversary. Waste Diversion at Corporate FacilitiesIn 2017, we continued to measure waste diversion rates at our Global Restaurant Support Centre, manufacturing facilities and distributions centres. Altogether, we achieved an overall waste diversion rate of approximately 86%*.Looking Forward: Burger King UKBurger King UK has announced a goal for all packaging used in its 500 restaurants nationwide to be recyclable, biodegradable or compostable by 2025. As a priority, the brand is working on the introduction of a new material for its drinking straws, which will significantly reduce the amount of plastic utilized annually. Tim Hortons has completed its transition of cold beverage cups in Canada and the United States from polystyrene to polypropylene, allowing for increased acceptance in recycling programs and improved overall environmental performance.Tim Hortons®Tim Hortons restaurants are continuously working to improve energy efficiency through lighting. In Canada, a new standard of LED menu boards is being implemented in all new and remodeled restaurants, and by 2021 LED lighting fixtures and lighting motion sensors to reduce energy usage will also be considered an established standard for restaurants throughout the country. Burger King®In 2017, all new Burger King restaurants built in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean incorporated a new fryer that reduces electricity consumption and decreases oil use by up to 30%. In the same year, a more energy efficient vertical toaster became the global standard for all new Burger King restaurants. This new model reduces electricity use by approximately 20% compared to the traditional model, and uses less consumable parts in operation. *This data is based on both measured and calculated waste that was produced at these facilities as landfill waste, recycling and organics. Measurements reflected the actual weights of waste produced during 2017. In the few instances where weights were not available, volume to weight conversions were used to provide estimates.Sustainable Building Design1819Across all of our brands, we foster one amazing culture that is supported by our values.Global Talent Development ProgramsIn 2017, we continued to grow and develop our two core Global Talent Development programs: the Leadership Development Program (LDP) and the MBA Leadership Program. Over the course of the year, we hired 67 LDPs and 9 MBA students – our largest-ever class of new recruits. Additionally, we saw 86 individuals trained in our week-long yellow belt program and 19 in our intensive green belt program. Looking forward, we plan to expand the depth and reach of our LDP program. In 2018, we plan on doubling the length of skills-based training for new recruits and expanding the onboarding for the program beyond North America for the first time. Wellness ProgramOur Wellness Program launched in 2016 to promote the health and wellness of our employees. Through education and initiatives, we encourage healthy habits and empower individuals to be accountable for their own well-being. The first two years of the program have covered topics such as Diet and Exercise, Heart Health Awareness, Stress Management and Breast Cancer Awareness. After two years of progress we are looking to expand the scope of our program, with topics such as: • Colorectal Cancer Awareness• Asthma and Allergy Awareness• Handling Stress during the Holidays• Migraine and Headache Awareness • Getting out of Debt• Alzheimer’s Awareness• Child Wellness Visits and Immunization AwarenessOur ValuesParental Leave PolicyAs part of our continuing commitment to our employees, we have implemented a new Parental Leave Policy for our field and corporate employees, globally.

The best submissions were rewarded with one of five prizes, including a grand prize of $25,000.A key part of our meritocratic culture means rewarding our employees for their hard work. That’s why, over the course of 2017, approximately 1 in 4 Restaurant Brands International employees received a promotion.Women’s Leadership ForumWe want to ensure that women at all levels of our organization feel supported in their development, which is why we launched our Women’s Leadership Forum in 2017.
